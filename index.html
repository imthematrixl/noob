        <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System.<br>
        and communication, and the messenger of the gods. <br> Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet,
        In English, <br> it is named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury),  <br>god of commerce
        with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.</p>

        <pre>Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio.
 This relationship is called spin–orbit resonance, and sidereal here means "relative to the stars".
Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts for around 176 Earth days:
 twice the planet's sidereal year. This means that one side of Mercury will remain in sunlight for one Mercurian year
 of 88 Earth days; while during the next orbit, that side will be in darkness all the time until the next sunrise after
 another 88 Earth days. Combined with its high orbital eccentricity, the planet's surface has widely varying sunlight 
 intensity and temperature, with the equatorial regions ranging from −170 °C (−270 °F) at night to 420 °C (790 °F) during 
 sunlight. Due to the very small axial tilt, the planet's poles are permanently shadowed. This strongly suggests that water 
 ice could be present in the craters. Above the planet's surface is an extremely tenuous exosphere and a faint magnetic
  field that is strong enough to deflect solar winds. Mercury has no natural satellite.</pre>
